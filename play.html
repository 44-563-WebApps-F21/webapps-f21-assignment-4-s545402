    <h1> Produced by Tirumala Swathi </h1>
    <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>
    <h4>_The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase_.</h4>
    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER</h6><p class="speech">In America those are the people we respect most.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class="speech">I have no doubt of it.</p>

    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER</h6> <p class="speech">Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is so simple, so
    sincere. He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever come
    across. It is a privilege to meet _him_.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class="speech">It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a young
    lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the opposite sex.
    English women conceal their feelings till after they are married. They
    show them then.</p>

   <h6 class="name HESTER"> HESTER</h6><p class="speech"> Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a young
    man and a young girl?</p>

   <p class="stage-direction"> [_Enter_ LADY HUNSTANTON, _followed by Footman with shawls and a
    cushion_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class="speech">We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was just saying
    what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet. You have a wonderful
    power of selection. It is quite a gift.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6> <p class="speech">Dear Caroline, how kind of you! I think we all do fit
    in very nicely together. And I hope our charming American visitor will
    carry back pleasant recollections of our English country life. [_To
    Footman_.] The cushion, there, Francis. And my shawl. The Shetland.
    Get the Shetland.</p> <p class="stage-direction">[_Exit Footman for shawl_.]</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h6> <p class="speech">Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you. Lord
    Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6><p class="speech"> His secretary? That is good news indeed, Gerald. It
    means a very brilliant future in store for you. Your dear mother will be
    delighted. I really must try and induce her to come up here to-night.
    Do you think she would, Gerald? I know how difficult it is to get her to
    go anywhere.</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h6><p class="speech"> Oh! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew Lord
    Illingworth had made me such an offer.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter Footman with shawl_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6> <p class="speech">I will write and tell her about it, and ask her to come
    up and meet him.</p> <p class="stage-direction">[_To Footman_.]</p> <p class="speech">Just wait, Francis.</p> <p class="stage-direction">[_Writes
    letter_.]</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class="speech">That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man as
    you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h6> <p class="speech">It is indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall be able to show
    myself worthy of it.</p>

    <h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6> <p class="speech">I trust so.</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h6> <p class="stage-direction">[_To_ HESTER.]</p><p class="speech"> _You_ have not congratulated me yet, Miss
    Worsley.</p>

   <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER</h6><p class="speech"> Are you very pleased about it?</p>

    <h6 class="name GERALD">GERALD</h6> <p class="speech">Of course I am. It means everything to me—things that were out
    of the reach of hope before may be within hope’s reach now.</p>

    <h6 class="name HESTER">HESTER</h6> <p class="speech">Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is a hope.</p>
