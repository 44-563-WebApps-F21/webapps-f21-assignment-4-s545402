    <h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6><p class="speech"> I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But that
may not be true.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYCAROLINE">LADY CAROLINE</h6><p class="speech"> I don’t think that England should be represented abroad
by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.</p>

<h6 class="name LADYHUNSTANTON">LADY HUNSTANTON</h6><p class="speech"></p> You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you are too
nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I was in hopes he
would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he said her family was too
large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget which.  I regret it very much.  She
was made to be an ambassador’s wife.</p>
